# Directus Schema Presets

This repository contains schemas that are commonly used in various applications. Use this with the [Schema Management Module](https://github.com/rezo-labs/directus-extension-schema-management-module) to easily & rapidly setup the data model of Directus apps.

In each folder, there are collections that are used in specific use cases. These collections contain predefined fields and relations with the optimal interfaces & displays. They are served as the base model, you can add more fields, or change the settings after importing to fit your use case.

Currently, we have 2 use cases:
- [Content Management System](./cms): Build a headless CMS for blogs.
- [E-commerce](./e-commerce): A base schema for e-commerce website.
